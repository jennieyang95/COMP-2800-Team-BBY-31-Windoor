1. Start in a squat position with your knees bent, back straight, and your feet about shoulder-width apart.
2. Lower your hands to the floor in front of you so they’re just inside your feet.
3. With your weight on your hands, kick your feet back so you’re on your hands and toes, and in a pushup position.
4. Keeping your body straight from head to heels, do one pushup. Remember not to let your back sag or to stick your butt in the air.
5. Do a frog kick by jumping your feet back to their starting position.
6. Stand and reach your arms over your head.
7. Jump quickly into the air so you land back where you started.
8. As soon as you land with knees bent, get into a squat position and do another repetition.
9. Repeat for 10 minutes.

SQUAT

1. Find a foot stance that feels best for you. Pointing your toes slightly outwards helps some, but keeping them parallel is fine, too.
   If you’re not sure what’s best, start by putting your feet shoulder-width apart and pointed about 15 degrees outwards.
2. Tense your abs like someone is about to punch you.
3. Look straight ahead and stand tall!
4. Repeat for 10 minutes.
