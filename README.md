## Windoor
> Windoor is a web application geared towards the general public to take care of your mental and physical well being. It provides users with features, such as tutorials on creating crafts and at-home workouts, that keep you entertained and during quarantine.
## Team31
> We are a group of 4 developers consisting of two Term 1 and two Term 2 students who are collaborating to improve the wellbeing of our community during COVID-19. Jenny and Jay have completed Term 1 and they’re excited to put their knowledge to use. They welcome hands-on projects because it’s a great way to challenge themselves and meet other developers. Tyler and Susan have finished Term 2 and they look forward to working alongside a hardworking and passionate team. Collaborating is what gets us going! We hope our app, Windoor, encourages safe social distancing while taking care of our mental and physical health.
